        <h2><a href="history.html">History</a></h2>
        <p>The history of India is a vast and fascinating journey that spans thousands of years, marked by the rise and fall of powerful civilizations, empires, and dynasties. The Indus Valley Civilization, one of the world’s earliest urban cultures, flourished around 2500 BCE, known for its advanced cities like Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro. India later saw the rise of the Maurya Empire, under Emperor Ashoka, who embraced Buddhism and spread its teachings across the subcontinent. The Gupta Empire is often regarded as a golden age of science, mathematics, and culture. In medieval times, the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire left a lasting legacy, with monumental architectural wonders like the Taj Mahal and advancements in art, literature, and trade. The British colonial period, which began in the 18th century, transformed India economically and socially but also spurred a nationalist movement led by figures like Mahatma Gandhi, resulting in India’s independence in 1947. Since independence, India has grown into a democratic, multicultural nation, maintaining its rich historical legacy while embracing modernity. This history, with its blend of ancient wisdom, cultural diversity, and colonial struggles, continues to shape the nation’s identity today.</p>
